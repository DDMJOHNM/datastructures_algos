Data structure organization of a computers memory, in order to retrive it quickly for processing.

## Classification of data structures. 
Linear -Lists, sets, tuples, queues, stacks, and heaps.

Non Linear - Trees, tables, and containers.

Honogenious - Two-dimensional and multidimensional.

Hetrogenious - Linked Lists, ordered lists and unordered lists. 

Dynamic - dictionaries, tree sets, and sequences.

## Structural design patterns 
Define relationships between entities, create system with different system blocks in a flexibile manner
Adapter, bridge, composite, decorator, facade, flyweight, private class data, and proxy are the Gang of Four (GoF) structural design patterns.

### - Adapter (DIP, Delegation) - principles adhered to 
- The adapter uses the interface of a class to be a class with another compatible interface.
- The adapter translates the incompatible interface of the adaptee into an interface that the client wants.
